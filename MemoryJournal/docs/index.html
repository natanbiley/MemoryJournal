    <h1>MemoryJournal Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="effective-date">Effective Date: January 3, 2026</p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Welcome to MemoryJournal. This privacy policy explains how we handle your information when you use our iOS application. Your privacy is important to us, and we are committed to protecting it.</p>

    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>MemoryJournal is designed with privacy in mind. We do not collect, transmit, or store any of your personal data on our servers.</p>
    
    <h3>Data Stored Locally</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Journal Entries:</strong> All your journal entries, including text and rich formatting, are stored locally on your device using Apple's SwiftData framework. This data never leaves your device unless you choose to back it up through iCloud (managed by Apple, not by us).</li>
        <li><strong>App Preferences:</strong> Settings and preferences are stored locally on your device.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Subscription and Payment Information</h2>
    <p>MemoryJournal offers optional premium subscriptions through Apple's In-App Purchase system. All payment processing is handled entirely by Apple through the App Store. We do not have access to your payment information, credit card details, or billing address.</p>
    
    <p>Apple may provide us with anonymous subscription status information (such as whether a subscription is active) but this cannot be linked to your personal identity.</p>

    <h2>iCloud Sync (Optional)</h2>
    <p>If you enable iCloud backup on your device, your journal entries may be backed up to your personal iCloud account. This is managed entirely by Apple through iOS system backups. We do not have access to your iCloud data.</p>

    <h2>Data We Do NOT Collect</h2>
    <p>We do not collect, store, or transmit:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Personal identifying information (name, email, phone number)</li>
        <li>Location data</li>
        <li>Usage analytics or tracking data</li>
        <li>Advertising identifiers</li>
        <li>Your journal content or entries</li>
        <li>Device information beyond what's required for app functionality</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>MemoryJournal does not integrate with any third-party analytics, advertising, or tracking services. The only third-party service interaction is with Apple's App Store for subscription management, which is governed by Apple's privacy policy.</p>

    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>MemoryJournal does not knowingly collect any information from children under the age of 13. The app is designed to be safe for users of all ages.</p>

    <h2>Data Security</h2>
    <p>Since all your data is stored locally on your device, the security of your journal entries is protected by your device's security features (passcode, Face ID, Touch ID, etc.). We recommend keeping your device locked and secure.</p>

    <h2>Your Rights and Control</h2>
    <p>You have complete control over your data:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Access:</strong> You can access all your journal entries directly in the app.</li>
        <li><strong>Deletion:</strong> You can delete individual entries or all data by deleting the app from your device.</li>
        <li><strong>Export:</strong> Your data remains on your device and can be backed up through standard iOS backup procedures.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this privacy policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new privacy policy on this page and updating the "Effective Date" above. Continued use of the app after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.</p>
